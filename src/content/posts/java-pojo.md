# POJO

> ### What is POJO?
> - Can't Extend anything
> - Can't Implement anything
> - No outside annotaion

```java
public class Cat {

  int age;
  String name;

}
```

- Not a POJO!

```java
public class Cat implements Animals {

  int age;
  String name;

  @Override
  public void run(){
    System.out.println(String.format("%s can be run", this.name));
  }

}
```
