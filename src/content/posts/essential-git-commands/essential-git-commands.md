# Essential Git Commands Every Developer Should Know

As a developer who uses Git daily, I've found that while Git has numerous commands, there's a core set that we use most frequently. In this guide, I'll share the essential Git commands that every developer should master, along with real-world examples and best practices.

## Getting Started with Git

### Initial Setup
Before diving into commands, ensure Git is properly configured:

```bash
# Set your identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Set default editor
git config --global core.editor "vim"
```

### Repository Initialization
Start a new Git repository or clone an existing one:

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

## Daily Workflow Commands

### Checking Status and Making Changes

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add filename.txt        # Add specific file
git add .                  # Add all files
git add *.js              # Add all JavaScript files

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message"
git commit -am "Add and commit in one command" # Only works for modified files
```

### Branching and Navigation

```bash
# List all branches
git branch                 # Local branches
git branch -r             # Remote branches
git branch -a             # All branches

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git switch -c feature/new-feature

# Switch between branches
git checkout main
git switch main

# Delete a branch
git branch -d branch-name  # Safe delete
git branch -D branch-name  # Force delete
```

## Working with Remote Repositories

### Remote Operations

```bash
# List remote repositories
git remote -v

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Fetch updates from remote
git fetch origin

# Pull changes from remote
git pull origin main

# Push changes to remote
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

## Reviewing Changes

### Viewing History and Differences

```bash
# View commit history
git log
git log --oneline         # Compact view
git log --graph           # Graphical view

# View changes
git diff                  # Working directory vs staging
git diff --staged        # Staging vs last commit
git diff branch1..branch2 # Between branches
```

## Advanced Operations

### Stashing Changes

```bash
# Save changes for later
git stash

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash
git stash apply

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Remove stash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

### Merging and Rebasing

```bash
# Merge a branch
git merge feature/new-feature

# Rebase current branch
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3      # Rebase last 3 commits
```

## Recovery and Undoing Changes

### Fixing Mistakes

```bash
# Undo last commit (keeping changes)
git reset HEAD~1

# Hard reset to specific commit
git reset --hard commit-hash

# Revert a commit
git revert commit-hash
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Messages
Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
```bash
# Good commit message format
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system

- Implement JWT token generation
- Add password hashing
- Create user validation middleware"
```

### 2. Branch Naming Conventions
Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
- `feature/` for new features
- `bugfix/` for bug fixes
- `hotfix/` for urgent fixes
- `release/` for release preparations

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

### 3. Regular Updates
Keep your local repository in sync:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main
```

## Git Workflow Tips

### Creating a Feature
```bash
# Start a new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"

# Update with main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/new-feature
git rebase main

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Code Review Process
```bash
# Update feature branch before review
git checkout feature/new-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Address review comments
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review comments"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Resolving Merge Conflicts
```bash
# When conflicts occur
git status                  # Check conflicting files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add resolved-file.txt
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Recovering Lost Changes
```bash
# View reflog
git reflog

# Recover lost commits
git checkout -b recovery-branch lost-commit-hash
```

## Conclusion

These Git commands form the foundation of version control in modern development. While there are many more Git commands available, mastering these essentials will handle most of your daily development needs. Remember to:

- Always write clear commit messages
- Keep your branches up to date
- Use meaningful branch names
- Regularly push your changes
- Review changes before committing

The more you use these commands, the more natural they'll become. Don't be afraid to experiment in a test repository to better understand how each command works.
